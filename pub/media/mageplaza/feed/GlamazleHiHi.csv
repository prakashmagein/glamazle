<p><span>Featuring a soft felt-tip precision applicator, this liner lets you flawlessly create any&nbsp;</span>eye makeup<span>&nbsp;look you desire&mdash;from sharp thin lines to dramatic bold lines without skipping or running.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>HOW TO APPLY</span></p>
<div class='dropdown-content'>
<ul>
<li>Shake well before use.</li>
<li>With light pressure, use the felt tip applicator to create sharp, precise lines. With more pressure, use the flat side of the applicator to create bolder, thicker lines.</li>

<span>Pro Tips:</span>
<ul>
<li>When not in use, always keep the cap on tightly and the component standing upright (with the felt tip liner facing down) so product is always ready to apply.</li>
<li>To ensure a precise application every time, wipe off the brush tip with a damp tissue to clean the brush between uses.</li>
<li>For a winged eyeliner look, begin by dotting along the lash line to map out the direction of the liner. First draw the tail end, creating a line that extends from the lash line outward. Then, draw a straight line starting at the center of the lid and connecting to the tail line. Line the lash line from the center of the lid toward the inner corner. Finish by filling in your outline to complete the look.</li>

"Anastasia Falses Lashes - Snasy","<p><span>Anastasia Beverly Hills&nbsp;</span><span>False Lashes</span><span>&nbsp;are premium-quality lashes that provide comfortable wear and deliver maximum impact. These lightweight, high-quality lashes are easy to apply and adhere to the lash line in seconds. Add volume, length and thickness to your lash look with ease (making mascara optional). Fashion is a set of sophisticated full-strip synthetic lashes with natural-looking, sexy length&mdash;yet they remain undetectable as they blend in with your natural lash line. Provides up to 20 wears.</span></p>
<p><span>HOW TO APPLY</span></p>
<div class='dropdown-content'>
<ul>
<li>APPLYING YOUR LASHES: Place a small amount of lash adhesive onto a metal mixing plate. Allow the adhesive to get tacky (about 1 minute). Then, dip the tail end of a pair of tweezers into the adhesive and apply the adhesive to the band of your&nbsp;<span>False Lashes</span>&nbsp;with control. Wait another 30 seconds. Holding your&nbsp;<span>False Lashes</span>&nbsp;at the center, gently press the false eyelashes onto the center of your upper lash line. Then, press down the outer edges of the lash band onto your lash line. Allow&nbsp;<span>False Lashes</span>&nbsp;to dry in place. For a more seamless lash look, secure your application by gently pinching the lash band and your lash line together.</li>
<li>REMOVING YOUR LASHES: Use your fingers to gently pull the band of the&nbsp;<span>False Lashes</span>&nbsp;starting from the outer corner and moving toward the center of your face. Be sure not to pull the faux lashes themselves to avoid tear. Avoid touching your natural lashes.</li>
<li>CLEANING YOUR LASHES: Immediately clean your&nbsp;<span>False Lashes</span>&nbsp;after use. Gently remove the adhesive by lightly massaging the lash band with your fingertip. To remove any excess adhesive that may remain on the band, first lay the lashes on a flat surface, then use a clean cotton swab dipped in a small amount of micellar water and gently wipe along the lash band. If any adhesive remains along your lash line, use a clean cotton swab dipped in a small amount of micellar water and gently wipe to remove.</li>
<li>STORING YOUR LASHES: When not in use, return your&nbsp;<span>False Lashes</span>&nbsp;to their storage case to keep them protected and to help maintain their proper shape. This also helps ensure your faux lashes go on seamlessly the next time you apply.</li>
</ul>
<span>Pro Tips:</span>
<ul>
<li>To help extend the life of your&nbsp;<span>False Lashes</span>, apply mascara to your natural lashes before your faux lash application to prevent too much product from getting on your&nbsp;<span>False Lashes</span>.</li>
