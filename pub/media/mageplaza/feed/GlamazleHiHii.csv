<p><u>Application Tips:</u></p>
<p>Mineral-based UV filters form a protective barrier to help reflect UV rays away from the skin’s surface. Because the ingredients in a mineral sunscreen stay on the surface of the skin to help protect it, a white cast can sometimes remain after applying the product. Follow these tips to apply your mineral sunscreen:</p>
<p>1. Dispense a small amount to one palm and rub your hands together.</p>
<p>2. Apply to one area of the face at a time and thoroughly massage into the skin.</p>
<p>3. The formula should spread easily without leaving a greasy residue or feel.</p>
<p>All sunscreens should be applied liberally for sun protection. It is essential to use any sunscreen product as directed.</p>
