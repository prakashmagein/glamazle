A flat, fine tip synthetic brush will work fabulously as well and is actually better for a more detailed application close to the lash line.

"681619805127","in stock","new","These liquid matte lipsticks are extremely creamy, glide on smooth and have a quick drying time. They are infused with peppermint oil which gives a very gentle tingle when you apply, and is super refreshing. At first glance these liquid lips had a slight sheen but this dries off and you are left with a flat, matte finish. This matte gloss is long lasting and eventually fades into an even stain on the lips that is non movable when it dries, so be careful while applying around the lip line because the darker shades will stain lighter skin tones quickly. That being said these colors are beautifully bold and vibrant. They don&rsquo;t feel drying on the lips and hardly need any touching up throughout the day.","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/pub/media/catalog/product/h/o/hon_1.jpg","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/the-balm-meet-matte-hughes-liquid-lipstick-honest.html?___store=default","TheBalm Meet Matte Hughes Liquid Lipstick - Honest","70.000000","TheBalm"

"Lipduo","in stock","new","My scrub gently buffs away dry skin to reveal a soft, smooth, pash-worthy pout. Finish with a slick of my petroleum free balm to keep lips hydrated.
KEY INGREDIENTS: LIP SCRUBGROUND ROBUSTA COFFEE AND COFFEE SEED OIL - This finely ground coffee gently polishes and buffs away dry skin cells, leaving your lips smooth, supple and ready to absorb my hydrating natural lip balm. Coffee seed oil stimulates the production of collagen and moisturises with essential fatty acids and vitamin E.
RAW SUGAR -&nbsp;These easily dissolved sugar crystals sweeten the deal, providing a gentle and even exfoliation to leave you with a super soft pout. Bonus: they taste delicious.
MACADAMIA OIL -&nbsp;Rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids, macadamia oil contains Palmitoleic acid, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are gently absorbed by the skin to provide a long lasting soft and silky feel.
ETHICALLY SOURCED BEESWAX -&nbsp;Leaves a long-lasting protective coating that shields your lips from the outside elements. The best thing about beeswax is that it&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antiviral, which helps with treating minor skin irritations.
KEY INGREDIENTS: LIP BALM
LANOLIN -&nbsp;This is an incredible, natural moisturiser that can hold over 200% its own weight in water, helping to hydrate your lips, without coating them in a nasty barrier like other petroleum based balms.
COFFEE ARABIC SEED OIL -&nbsp;This special coffee oil has a high concentration of essential fatty acids and vitamin E, making it a great antioxidant that protects skin from environmental damage, dryness, and moisture loss. It also stimulates the production of collagen and hyaluronic acid.
VITAMIN E -&nbsp;This powerful antioxidant protects and repairs your skin, cooling and soothing irritations caused by environmental and UV damage, as well as relieving chapped lips.
COCONUT AND GRAPE SEED OIL -&nbsp;These two hydrating natural oils soften the skin while promoting healing, elasticity, and suppleness. These non-sticky, lightweight oils leave a satin-like finish on the skin that&rsquo;s light enough to act as a base for lipstick and glossy enough to stand-alone.","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/pub/media/catalog/product/f/r/frank_lip-balm-scrub.jpg","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/frank-lip-scrub-lip-balm-duo.html?___store=default","Frank Lip Scrub & Lip Balm Duo","101.000000","Frank"

Ideal for all skin types, including dry skin, oily skin, sensitive skin, acne-prone skin, and combination skin.
How to use:
The Camellia Cleansing Oil should be used as the first part of the double cleansing step in your skincare routine, before a face wash or other traditional cleansers. Begin with dry hands and a dry face. Apply 1-2 pumps into the palm of your hand. Massage into skin in circular motions. Rinse with warm water. The oil will emulsify into a milk, melting away makeup and impurities effortlessly. Safe for use around the eye area. Can be used morning and night

No matter what look you&rsquo;re going for, the UD Pro Contour Shapeshifter Brush has you covered. The domed brush makes it easy to lay down a lot of product and blend out the edges. Think of it as a mini version our UD Pro Optical Blurring Brush. Stipple on color to get the payoff you desire, then buff the edges to diffuse. The fan brush lays down just the right amount of highlighter for that flawless, glowy, &ldquo;I woke up like this&rdquo; look.Like all of our brushes, our UD Pro Contour Shapeshifter Brush is artist-quality and cruelty-free. Plus, it&rsquo;s easy on the eyes AND the environment. The brushed gunmetal handle is made from recycled aluminum, and the super-soft, synthetic hair (made from recycled plastic bottles) mimics real hair&mdash;from the feel to the pickup and laydown. Another bonus: Synthetic brush hair doesn&rsquo;t hold on to gross bacteria the way porous animal hair can, so it&rsquo;s easier to clean and more hygienic.","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/pub/media/catalog/product/d/s/ds_2_3.jpg","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/urban-decay-cosmetics-ud-pro-contour-shapeshifter-brush.html?___store=default","URBAN DECAY COSMETICS UD Pro Contour Shapeshifter Brush","200.000000","Urban Decay"

The newly reformulated yet still super-potent vitamin C day serum is brimming with antioxidants, essential nutrients and fruit enzymes, all of which work together to firm and brighten the appearance of skin and minimise signs of ageing. It's powered by 15% pure l-ascorbic acid (a potent form of vitamin C), 0.5% ferulic acid and 1% vitamin E — supported by a host of antioxidants and enzymes — which work to neutralise aggressors and replenish precious lipids to diminish the visibility of lines and pigment patches.
Also starring pumpkin ferment and pomegranate extracts, the serum enzymatically dissolves dead surface skin cells for a smoother-than-smooth texture. Finally, a sodium hyaluronate cross-polymer quickly penetrates your skin and provides intense hydration. The result? A noticeably brighter, more radiant complexion, with signs of ageing and photo damage minimised.




Hint: Mix it with A-Passioni™ during the daytime for even greater protection against UV-generated free radical damage, plus better glow-boosting and skin-firming benefits.



Key Ingredients:&nbsp;

&nbsp;Potent Antioxidant Complex (15% L-Ascorbic Acid plus Ferulic Acid and 1% Vitamin E): Firms and brightens the look and feel of skin while minimizing the signs of photoaging from pollution and other environmental stressors.
Pumpkin Ferment and Pomegranate Extract: These ingredients work together to enzymatically dissolve dead surface skin cells, minimizing the appearance of pores .
Chronocyclin: A chronopeptide that mimics the antioxidant benefits of vitamin D for more youthful-looking skin.

How To Use:

Unscrew the cap of the liquid serum base and remove the pump from the vial containing the 15% I-ascorbic acid power.
Pour all of the liquid serum base into the vial with the powder. Screw the pump onto the top of the vial and shake for one minute until the powder dissolves fully. Bubbles will form-that's OK!
Finally, insert the vial into C-Firma's opaque outer container with the pump facing to the left until it snaps into place. Your C-Firma™ Fresh Day Serum is ready to use.

Suggested use: In the morning, apply one pump to a clean, dry face, neck,chest, and backs of hands, or mix it into your daily Drunk Elephant skincare smoothie. Don’t forget to top it off with sunscreen!&nbsp;

Appearing snowy white to the naked-eye, each lip strobe has a unique pearl complex that reveals its unique colour once applied to the lips. Just a swipe of the gloss will turn the base lip colour into incandescent hues of white gold, opalescent blue, cool pink, or alluring coral.
Packed with iridescent shimmer and duo-chrome glitter, these semi-sheer glosses are gorgeous worn alone or on top of your favourite lip colour to create an infinite array of frosty shades. The comfortable, non-sticky formula glides on with ease, delivering an even coat for a luminous finish.
Huda says: &ldquo;I was super inspired by the ice queen persona when I was creating these shades. At first glance, the four strobes are very similar but each one reveals a surprising pop of pigment and shimmer for a gorgeous luminous wintry look. Each one is so gorgeous and enchanting, I literally can&rsquo;t pick a favourite! What I love so much about this collection is that we have paired each of the mini strobe shades to the colours in the Winter Solstice Highlighter palette so that they are completely complementary &ndash; something we had never done before now!&rdquo;
&bull; Starcrossed Lip Strobe: With duo-chrome tones in white gold and bronze, this gloss creates a natural finish for a luminous winter touch.&bull; Bewitched Lip Strobe &ndash; This multi-tonal strobe will surprise and delight with its warm blue and purple undertones for a delicate opalescent effect.&bull; Hypnotic Lip Strobe &ndash; The perfect combination of cool pink and silver undertones deliver a stunning metallic effect for an out-of-this-world sheen.&bull; Charmed Lip Strobe &ndash; The multi-chromatic and reflective pearls have a subtle coral tone that will add a new dimension to your look.

"TC-MF-TH","in stock","new","WHAT IT ISA vegan &amp; oil-free full coverage foundation that feels weightless on skin, with a modern matte finish.
WHAT IT DOESProvides the same full coverage as its concealing predecessor &ndash; it smooths over pores &amp; imperfections with rich, airbrushed full coverage that dries to a flawless matte finish using a unique, concealer-inspired wand. The formula absorbs oil &amp; shine while leaving skin creaseless, hydrated, free of flakiness or cakiness &amp; helping to improve skin health with every application.
HOW TO USE

Use the product&rsquo;s applicator to dab foundation directly onto skin. Starting at the center of the face, apply three swipes of foundation on each cheek. Using what is left on the wand, add two swipes on the forehead, one down the nose, and two on the chin. For best results, blend out with the&nbsp;paddle to perfection foundation brush&nbsp;in circular motions until the foundation is fully blended. For fuller coverage, apply additional swipes and blend until you&rsquo;ve reached your desired level of coverage.

"769915193596","in stock","new","Want to brighten your skin and defy signs of ageing (we’re talking discolouration, fine lines and dark circles) overnight? You need The Ordinary’s Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone. In its pure form of L-Ascorbic acid, vitamin C is an effective antioxidant that has been shown to visibly brighten skin and reduce signs of ageing when applied topically. This waterless formula provides skin with a very high concentration (30%) of pure L-Ascorbic acid that remains completely stable due to the absence of water. The addition of very light silicones means that this formulation feels gorgeously smooth on the skin, although a strong (but non-irritating) sensation can be expected during the first 1-2 weeks of use until the skin’s tolerance to a high concentration of vitamin C is improved (the formula can be mixed with other creams and serums to reduce this sensation if needed). Ideally applied at night, this fabulous formula works hard while you do the opposite, leaving you with smooth, bright and even skin when morning comes around.","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/pub/media/catalog/product/o/r/ord023_theordinary_vitamincsupspension30silicone_1_1560x1960-vczp3.jpg","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/the-ordinary-vitamin-c-suspension-silicone.html?___store=default","The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 30% In Silicone","40.000000","The Ordinary"

Warm up to smoother skin and refined pores. This innovative facial scrub is inspired by traditional Scandinavian spas, revered as places of both mental and physical relaxation.

Formulated with Icelandic volcanic sand, Green Fusion Complex&trade; and neem seed oil, its deeply purifying action absorbs excess oil and helps effectively unclog and minimize the appearance of pores. The scrub invigorates with a refreshing eucalyptus-peppermint scent, leaving the complexion smooth, soft and refreshed with a healthy-looking Ole Glow&reg;!

"AR_SI-Passione","in stock","new","In December 2017, Armani launches a new edition of S&igrave; fragrance from 2013, represented by Hollywood actress Cate Blanchett.&nbsp;S&igrave; Passione is a reinterpretation of the original that gives it a new dimension - described as 'an irresistible combination of grace, strength and independent spirit.' Announced as an intense, uncompromising scent, it is made for a confident woman who dares to say yes, and is to embody the red lipstick effect in the bottle.
S&igrave; Passione&nbsp; is a bright and sensual perfume that emits confidence, seduction, and strength. Bright and fresh in its initial impression,&nbsp;S&igrave; Passione&nbsp; opens with notes of spicy pink pepper, like a burst of adrenaline. After initially drawing attention, sparkling and radiant pear brightens the iconic juicy blackcurrant to add boldness. A floral heart beats passionately with rose and feminine jasmine to create a powerful scent, like a seemingly fragile woman who shows incredible strength when guided by passion. The addition of heliotrope makes this perfume addictive and acts as an invitation to self-indulgence and pleasure. The warm and sensual vanilla and cedarwood dry down mirrors the self-assurance that a swipe of red lipstick can instantly give the wearer.'","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/pub/media/catalog/product/3/6/3614271994844_02-o__4.jpg","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/giorgio-armani-si-passione-for-women-100ml-eau-de-parfum.html?___store=default","Giorgio Armani Si Passione Eau de Parfum 100ml for Her","550.000000","Giorgio Armani"

DETAILS: Ideal for all skin types, great for acne prone skin. Nut based product.
USAGE: Ideal for nighttime use.
SCENT: Strong natural earthy aroma.

This precious oil is extracted from the nut kernels of the Tamanu fruit -- which flourishes in the south pacific islands of Polynesia, due to its volcanic atmosphere. Volcanoes have an extraordinary effect on their surrounding soil. Not only does volcanic ash provide nutrients to soil, but it also contains minerals that are beneficial to plants. Due to this very reason, the Tamanu oil originating from Polynesia contains the&nbsp;highest nutritional value.The properties of this oil are known to help regenerate skin tissue. The Volcanic Elixir, for this unique reason, can condition broken skin, and repair sun- and acne-damaged skin. It also has&nbsp;anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antibiotic, and antioxidant properties&nbsp;-- making it ideal for acne sufferers. What sets this oil apart from others, is a certain lipid called calophyllolide; which is&nbsp;not found in any other oil, and is a very strong anti-inflammatory.The Volcanic Elixir aids in regenerating new, healthy skin. It can be used on acne and acne scars, dry and scaly skin, stretch marks, etc. The oil does have a strong earthy scent; but only a few drops are needed. It's the perfect night time regimen!
How to use

Shake well before use. Apply to face and neck, before going to bed for best results.&nbsp;Caution:&nbsp;Discontinue use if redness or irritation occurs. Keep out of eyes. For external use only.

The oil-free, lightweight, glow-boosting hybrid is formulated with ultra-soothing watermelon extract, hydrating hyaluronic acid, and gentle AHAs that work while you sleep to tone and clarify roughened, dull complexions. AHAs smooth the surface of the skin by banishing dead, rough surface cells, clearing the path for ultra-effective, lasting hydration, while hyaluronic acid binds moisture to the skin for an incredibly nourished complexion. Skin is baby-soft and bright in the morning, effortlessly.&nbsp;
Suggested Usage:-To use as a sleeping mask: use two scoops or a generous layer on skin as the final step of the evening routine. For drier skin types, layer an additional dime-sized amount onto the skin. Be sure to gently pat, not rub, mask into skin until absorbed and wash thoroughly in the morning.-To use as a wash-off mask (ideal for sensitive or stressed skin): use the spatula to scoop the face mask and spread a thick layer gently across the face from forehead to chin. Rinse with lukewarm water after 10 minutes.-Due to the highly natural makeup of the Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask formula, some separation may occur. Mix the formula vigorously with the included spoon for a full minute to allow the formula time to fully re-incorporate. Afterwards, your mask should have a gelatinous, gel-like texture.&nbsp;","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/pub/media/catalog/product/r/e/recccipe-1.jpg","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/glow-recipe-watermelon-glow-sleeping-mask-1-oz-30-ml.html?___store=default","GLOW RECIPE Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask - 1 oz/ 30 mL","99.000000","Glow Recipe"

"GL-011","in stock","new","A portable pen to clear zits at high speed. Unlike visible spot treatments (usually used overnight, in secrecy, at home), Zit Stick is designed to live in your pocket, bag, and daily life. Use at the first sign of a pimple, applying up to three times daily until your zit is gone&mdash;5% Benzoyl Peroxide kills the germs that caused the zit while shrinking size and swelling, with Tea Tree Oil and Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (a less irritating derivative of Salicylic Acid). Click three times, glide over zit with the antimicrobial stainless steel tip, and wait a few moments for it to dry to a translucent, go-about-your-day finish.
How to use:
To get started:

With a fresh Zit Stick, twist the pen at least 16 full turns (or more) until the formula appears on the rollerball.
For sensitive skin, we recommend patch testing on your arm first. If Zit Stick doesn&rsquo;t work for you, our team is here to help.

To apply:

Click the pen 3-6 times maximum and glide rollerball directly onto zit, limiting to a small surface area (the formula should look translucent&mdash;not opaque).
Apply 1-3 times per day until your pimple is gone.

Unlike physical exfoliators that scrape off the surface of your skin, Solution gently sloughs dead cells away through chemical exfoliation, ungluing the problematic dead cells hiding and clogging healthy skin beneath. With daily use, expect cleared acne and blackheads, smaller pores, and reduced redness. Skin’s texture will be smoother and softer, and the fabled glow of balanced, healthy skin will be in full force. Solution contains a particular 10% blend of three acid groups: Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA), Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA), and Polyhydroxy Acid (PHA). Acids are your friend.
How to use:
Once a day after cleansing, press cotton pad on top of dispenser and pump down to saturate. Sweep pad across face and neck. Allow a moment for Solution to absorb into skin. Follow with moisturizer and daily sunscreen.
WHY IT'S SPECIAL:


Unlike physical scrubs, Solution uses a 10% blend of skincare acids to “unglue” dead skin and sweep it away, so your complexion appears smoother, softer, and glowier

If irritation persists, discontinue use and consult a physician. Use only as directed. Contact of the product with the skin must be of limited frequency or duration.

This multi-tasking skin-protecting, makeup-perfecting primer for face, eyes and lips.

Blurs:&nbsp;Silk extracts feel nourishing on skin and instantly diminish the look of pores, fines lines and imperfections for the perfect canvas before makeup.
Primes:&nbsp;Silk powder makes makeup glide on more evenly and last longer, minimizing excess shine with a soft focus finish.
Protects:&nbsp;Protective barrier derived from botanicals acts as a barrier between makeup and skin, helping to prevent clogged pores that can lead to breakouts. Anti-pollution natural active ingredients fight immediate attack from environmental stressors and help support the skin's barrier function to act against future attack, visibly reducing the appearance of wrinkles and dullness.
Enhances:&nbsp;Pink and gold pearl helps even skin tone for a healthy look.
Anti-aging:&nbsp;Hadasei-3&trade;, a trinity of Japanese superfoods, green tea, rice and algae, visibly restores youthful radiance.

Suggested Usage:-Glide the spatula lightly across the top of balm.&nbsp;-A little goes a long way; use a rice-sized amount for the whole face.&nbsp;-With fingertips, dot the formula on your forehead, nose, chin, eyelids, and cheeks.&nbsp;-Gently massage the balm onto your face and allow the silk to melt into a second skin before applying foundation.&nbsp;-The Silk Canvas should be applied as the last step in any skincare ritual.&nbsp;-It can be used alone or with makeup, and is suitable for use on face, eyes, and lips.

"TO-103","in stock","new","The Mineral UV Filter formulas avoid the use of any nanoparticles. Instead, a refined dispersion of micronized ZnO and TiO2 in flexible, high-volatility, non-comedogenic silicones allows the formulations to remain extremely lightweight by optimizing the amount of the blocking agents. Our formulation uses mainly ZnO for its protective effects (because in addition to reflecting/refracting light, ZnO is actually also able to absorb UV rays without creating oxygen radicals) and the supporting TiO2 that it contains is only in rutile form (no anatase form of TiO2 is used at all since it's an aggressive producer of free radicals).The technologies shared in Mineral UV Filter Formulas&rsquo; are:Bio-Active Antioxidant NetworkA potent combination that scavenges and neutralizes free radicals, minimizes the intensity of UV radiation penetrating the skin, visibly protects biological membranes and supports the skin response to UV exposure.&nbsp;Bio-Sugar ComplexA unique blend of hygroscopic molecules with Multi-layer coverage providing both short and long-term hydration and also naturally increases skin&rsquo;s own capacity to hold water.Skin Identical LipidsLipids that visibly restore the compromised barrier and prevents transepidermal water loss (TEWL).Tasmanian PepperberryRich in flavanones, anthocyanins, and minerals, this active technology helps to calm stressed skin, acting almost immediately.
Directions
Apply to face liberally and evenly 15 to 20 minutes before UV exposure. If continued UV exposure is expected, to maintain protection, reapply at least every 2 hours or after material water exposure, towel-drying, swimming or extensive perspiration. Suitable for all skin tones. For children under 6 months of age, consult a doctor prior to use. Use a water-resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating. For external use only. Do not use on damaged or broken skin. When using this product keep out of eyes. Rinse with water to remove. Stop use and ask a doctor if rash occurs.","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/pub/media/catalog/product/o/r/ord050_theordinary_mineralspf30_1560x1960-o6s9h.jpg","https://stage-glamazle.hyperx.cloud/the-ordinary-mineral-uv-filters-spf-30-with-antioxidants.html?___store=default","The Ordinary Mineral UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants","52.000000","The Ordinary"

"TO-104","out of stock","new","This gentle cleanser is anything but ordinary, removing make up and impurities as it retains your skin&rsquo;s moisture &ndash; unlike some harsher cleansers, there&rsquo;s no need to worry about tightness after using this. Star of the show is squalane, a first-class hydrator that&rsquo;s found naturally in the skin, helping to prevent loss of moisture and boost suppleness. This combines with other lipophilic esters to dissolve make up and unwanted grime for clean and clog-free pores. The hard-working formula feels balm-like when first applied, changing to a clear oil-like texture when warmed into your skin &ndash; an important feat that allows emulsifying sucrose esters to capture the dissolved make up and dirt and rinse them away. Free from soap, which can cause irritation or &lsquo;strip&rsquo; the skin, this crowd-pleasing cleanser respects your complexion&rsquo;s natural epidermal lipids, making it suitable for all skin types &ndash; even sensitive ones.&nbsp;
HOW TO USE

Rub the cleanser in your palms to warm it until it melts into an oil. Massage into dry skin, then rinse with warm water.

How to help blemish-prone skin chill out.


Does your skin feel stressed? Out of balance, oily, or on the verge of a breakout...whatever it is, consider the&nbsp;5% Niacinamide&nbsp;and&nbsp;Zinc PCA&nbsp;in Super Pure your new best friends. Together, they work to balance and clarify complexion with a cooling, water-gel formula (that never leaves skin feeling sticky or greasy). Niacinamide gets to work on the look of uneven texture while Zinc PCA targets impurities and reduces oil-slick shine, helping you let go and start fresh. Use it after a night of junk food or that time right before your period. Adding it to your daily routine will&nbsp;keep skin in check over time. There&rsquo;s a reason they say the best offense is a good defense.

What is it?
An eyebrow detailing pen.
Your brows are already great (you know that). But maybe you want more. More definition, more color, more brow in places you think deserve more brow.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s why you use the Brow Flick&mdash;a brush-tip detailing pen that fills in brows with featherlight strokes that actually look real. Use it to define the arch, extend the tail, and add depth to sparse areas.&nbsp;

How to Use:
Begin with clean brows&mdash;a fresh surface makes it easier to use Brow Flick. Shake pen to activate. Holding the pen at a downwards angle, start where your brows are more sparse and etch lightly anywhere you&rsquo;d like added dimension or definition. Leave to dry for 15 seconds or more. Brush up with&nbsp;Boy Brow&nbsp;to groom and hold.

"TO-107","in stock","new","Salicylic Acid 2% Masque is formulated to target lackluster tone and textural irregularities. The formula, infused with charcoal and clays, aims to enhance the appearance of smoothness and clarity, leaving the skin feeling refreshed. The structure of salicylic acid facilitates its lipophilicity and miscibility with the lipids located on the surface of the skin.
It is a suitable ingredient for targeting the removal of dead skin cells on the surface of oily and blemish-prone skin, with the purpose of revealing more radiant skin beneath. Charcoal and clays are ingredients renowned for their deep cleansing abilities due to their porosity and large surface area available for adsorption. They aid the removal of facial impurities that would otherwise remain on the skin surface and clog pores. In comparison to Salicylic Acid 2% Solution, Salicylic Acid 2% Masque is a rinse-off formula. Leave on for no longer than 10 minutes in order to maximize the exfoliating benefits.
How To Use:&nbsp;

Use once or twice a week on thoroughly clean, dry skin. Do not use on wet skin.
Apply evenly across face using fingertips, avoiding the eye area.
Leave on for no more than 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water.
Do not use on sensitive, peeling or compromised skin.
Avoid the eye contour and contact with eyes both during application and rinse off.
Patch testing prior to use is advised: Apply the product as directed to a small area once a day for three days to test if you are sensitive to this product. If you develop severe irritation, hives, swelling of eyes and mouth, blistering, or difficulty breathing, rinse off, cease use and consult a physician right away. Keep out of reach of children.

"ABH01-21422","in stock","new","Anastasia Beverly Hills&nbsp;Liquid Liner&nbsp;is a waterproof, highly pigmented, true-black matte liquid&nbsp;eyeliner&nbsp;that glides on evenly and delivers precise lines with ease. 
Featuring a soft felt-tip precision applicator, this liner lets you flawlessly create any&nbsp;eye makeup&nbsp;look you desire&mdash;from sharp thin lines to dramatic bold lines without skipping or running.&nbsp;
HOW TO APPLY


Shake well before use.
With light pressure, use the felt tip applicator to create sharp, precise lines. With more pressure, use the flat side of the applicator to create bolder, thicker lines.

Pro Tips:

When not in use, always keep the cap on tightly and the component standing upright (with the felt tip liner facing down) so product is always ready to apply.
To ensure a precise application every time, wipe off the brush tip with a damp tissue to clean the brush between uses.
For a winged eyeliner look, begin by dotting along the lash line to map out the direction of the liner. First draw the tail end, creating a line that extends from the lash line outward. Then, draw a straight line starting at the center of the lid and connecting to the tail line. Line the lash line from the center of the lid toward the inner corner. Finish by filling in your outline to complete the look.
Can be used on the face and body to create detailed line work.

A creamy, nourishing serum that calms signs of sensitivity caused by a broken skin barrier. A blend of nourishing oils and rebalancing actives restore damaged skin to clear breakouts and soothe irritation. Skin looks clear, feels calm, and probably sounds amazing.
Who needs it

Someone who needs to press reset on their irritated skin. More specifically:

who washes their face more than twice a day
who overdoes skincare by using harsh acne treatments or anti-aging products too often
whose skin is constantly dehydrated
who has constant redness and dry patches
who is sensitive to many skincare products
who has chronic stress (yes, cortisol affects the skin barrier too!)
who is looking to get rid of hyperpigmentation
who has aging or mature skin
anyone who intends to maintain a healthy skin barrier function
who has skin problems associated with a damaged skin barrier

How to&nbsp;indulge

Apply one or two pumps of Great Barrier Relief before your moisturizer or in replacement of your moisturizer. No rules, really! Reach for Great Barrier Relief whenever your skin is feeling irritated and don’t forget to remove those sensitizing products from your routine.

A Calming Hand
Our skin and the environment don’t always get along. Whether it’s because you’re a city dweller or got too pump-happy with the retinol, your skin needs some back up. Great Barrier Relief is there to lend a hand, no bat symbol required. GBR works by repairing damage in the skin barrier—the skin’s invisible shield. It helps repair tears and strengthen the barrier wall to kick environmental aggressors to the curb. It may be green, but it’s got a black belt in kicking ass.
Ingredients
PETA-certified vegan and cruelty-free. Always free of fragrances, essential oils, dyes, and colorants.
The color and texture of Great Barrier Relief may naturally vary slightly from batch to batch. No worries! This is a normal occurrence when using naturally-derived ingredients and it does not impact the efficacy of the formula.
Note: Great Barrier Relief does contain 10% Tamanu Oil, which is derived from Tamanu nuts. Though most people don’t have issues using this ingredient, people with nut allergies could have a potential reaction. If you think your skin will react, we recommend performing a 24-hour patch test on your wrist and neck first and slowly integrating GBR into your routine thereafter. If you do experience an allergic reaction, stop using the product immediately and seek medical attention if needed.

An antioxidant cleanser that doesn’t mess up your skin barrier, lifting everything your skin doesn't want while leaving what it needs—healthy pH, hydration, antioxidants and no irritation. Matcha and hemp seeds are here to boost&nbsp;the skin’s intake of antioxidants and essential fatty acids. Your skin and this cleanser might be a matcha made in heaven!
Skincare wisdom tells us that a super clean face = super tight skin, but we’re calling BS on that. We think a good cleanser can be effective and gentle at the same time. Cue Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser, the face wash that leaves your skin feeling cleaner and better. It uses coconut-based surfactants to deeply cleanse without stripping skin. Instead, nourishing Matcha and Hemp Seed Oil restore hydration and antioxidants to the skin. Seems like the wise choice to us!
How to indulge
Morning and night, apply Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser on a wet face and neck, and gently massage into skin. Never be aggressive! Rinse with lukewarm water. Splashing cold or hot water can do more harm than good, so let's not shock our skin. If makeup is present, using a suitable makeup remover before would be a skin-friendlier option.&nbsp;

"ABH01-10014","in stock","new","Anastasia Beverly Hills&nbsp;False Lashes&nbsp;are premium-quality lashes that provide comfortable wear and deliver maximum impact. These lightweight, high-quality lashes are easy to apply and adhere to the lash line in seconds. Add volume, length and thickness to your lash look with ease (making mascara optional). Fashion is a set of sophisticated full-strip synthetic lashes with natural-looking, sexy length&mdash;yet they remain undetectable as they blend in with your natural lash line. Provides up to 20 wears.
HOW TO APPLY


APPLYING YOUR LASHES: Place a small amount of lash adhesive onto a metal mixing plate. Allow the adhesive to get tacky (about 1 minute). Then, dip the tail end of a pair of tweezers into the adhesive and apply the adhesive to the band of your&nbsp;False Lashes&nbsp;with control. Wait another 30 seconds. Holding your&nbsp;False Lashes&nbsp;at the center, gently press the false eyelashes onto the center of your upper lash line. Then, press down the outer edges of the lash band onto your lash line. Allow&nbsp;False Lashes&nbsp;to dry in place. For a more seamless lash look, secure your application by gently pinching the lash band and your lash line together.
REMOVING YOUR LASHES: Use your fingers to gently pull the band of the&nbsp;False Lashes&nbsp;starting from the outer corner and moving toward the center of your face. Be sure not to pull the faux lashes themselves to avoid tear. Avoid touching your natural lashes.
CLEANING YOUR LASHES: Immediately clean your&nbsp;False Lashes&nbsp;after use. Gently remove the adhesive by lightly massaging the lash band with your fingertip. To remove any excess adhesive that may remain on the band, first lay the lashes on a flat surface, then use a clean cotton swab dipped in a small amount of micellar water and gently wipe along the lash band. If any adhesive remains along your lash line, use a clean cotton swab dipped in a small amount of micellar water and gently wipe to remove.
STORING YOUR LASHES: When not in use, return your&nbsp;False Lashes&nbsp;to their storage case to keep them protected and to help maintain their proper shape. This also helps ensure your faux lashes go on seamlessly the next time you apply.

Pro Tips:

To help extend the life of your&nbsp;False Lashes, apply mascara to your natural lashes before your faux lash application to prevent too much product from getting on your&nbsp;False Lashes.

Water- and silicone-free, The Ordinary&rsquo;s Retinol 0.2% in Squalane features highly stable retinol, an ingredient that can reduce the appearance of ageing with impressive results. A powerhouse form of vitamin A, retinol encourages cell turnover, revealing healthier, softer skin while also tackling blemishes, dark spots and defying signs of ageing &ndash; including softening the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and uneven tone. Retinol can cause significant irritation, including redness and peeling &ndash; but many feel that its significant effects counterbalance this; The Ordinary recommends building your skin&rsquo;s tolerance to retinol with lower concentrations such as this to minimise discomfort.
HOW TO USE

Apply a small amount to face in the PM as part of your skincare regimen, after water serums but before heavier treatments. Do not use with other retinoid treatments. Avoid unprotected solar exposure. Store in a cool, dry place.
Note: When pregnant or breastfeeding, it is recommended to avoid any skincare products containing retinoids such as formulations with Granactive Retinoid or Retinol.
Caution: Retinoids can make the skin more sensitive to UV radiation. Sun protection is particularly important when using retinoids. This product must not be used in conjunction with other retinoids including retinol or retinoic acid. This product is not a treatment for acne. Acne-prone skin may experience a temporary increase in acne during the first few weeks of using any form of retinoid including those used in this formulation.&nbsp;

Non-greasy and doesn&rsquo;t weigh you down. The perfect partner in (hair) crime.

INSIDE ME
COMFREY ROOT


The secret to hair commercial hair isn&rsquo;t a wind machine, it&rsquo;s this. Comfrey Root restores moisture to make hair as soft as silk and shiny as new.&nbsp;


COFFEE
My not-so-secret ingredient. There's a reason I put it in all of my products babe. It promotes a healthy scalp which equals healthy hair.
&nbsp;

NIACINAMIDE
This sounds fancy, because it is. This B-complex improves health of hair follicles and reduces scalp irritation. It also rebuilds Keratin proteins which acts as a protective core for overall hair health.

HYDROLISED KERATIN

No one likes a fake which is why this healthy alternative to synthetic conditioners is the therapy your hair&rsquo;s been waiting to see. It coats and penetrates the hair shaft to help reduce breakage, fizz and soften hair without filling your head with nasties.
&nbsp;
HOW TO USE ME&nbsp;


Step 1

Following my Caffeinated Scalp Scrub, apply a coin sized amount of my Caffeinated Hair Mask to freshly shampooed hair.
&nbsp;

Step 2
Gently work mask through hair from root to tip.
&nbsp;

Step 3
Wait 10 minutes, do some kegel exercises, a plank or scrub the rest of your bod with my Original Coffee Scrub.
&nbsp;
Step 4Rinse. No need for conditioner. Repeat 2-3 times a week for best results.

INSIDE ME&nbsp;

&nbsp;
GREEN COFFEE
Rich in fatty acids and antioxidants, this bad boy improves scalp health which in turn promotes healthier hair. Translation: Rapunzel would be jelly.
&nbsp;
ROSEMARY
Looks delicate but it packs a punch (like you). Rosemary is Mother Nature's gift to hair. I can't make promises, but the before and after photos from my babes speak for themselves.
&nbsp;
EUCALYPTUS
Like sunflowers in sunshine, Eucalyptus creates the perfect environment for hair to sprout from. It helps to reduce inflammation in the scalp so you grow healthy hair from a healthy place.
&nbsp;
PEPPERMINT
A little pepp-me-up for hair that&rsquo;s feeling a bit down. Increases blood circulation around the scalp, helps to remove product build up and leaves your hair smelling delicious after.
&nbsp;
HOW TO USE


Step 1
Wet &amp; part hair

&nbsp;
Step 2

The C-50 Blemish Night Treatment helps to treat blemishes and prevent future outbreaks by warding off blemish causing bacteria. The title ingredient C-50, or sodium ascorbyl phosphate, minimises the appearance of blemishes while encouraging your skin to heal itself. The formula also calls upon the pore-perfecting ingredient we all know and love, salicylic acid, to empower this treatment with exfoliating goodness and clearing power.
DESCRIPTION

Having one of those weeks where the LAST thing you want to deal with is a bout of pesky spots? Us. Too. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re inordinately excited for The Inkey List&rsquo;s C-50 Blemish Night Treatment, an overnight mask that minimises existing and prevents potential breakouts. C-50 is a stable vitamin C derivative that brightens and evens your tone so that blemishes appear diminished, while simultaneously encouraging the renewal of your cells for quicker healing times. The BHA salicylic acid exfoliates your skin, clearing away dead skin so it won&rsquo;t clog your pores and develop into blemishes. Regulating your skin&rsquo;s oil production, evening your tone and targeting the type of bacteria that causes blemishes to appear, the C-50 Blemish Night Treatment is a definite must-have for blemish-prone or oily skin types.&nbsp;
HOW TO USE

Massage onto a cleansed face and neck in the PM.&nbsp;

"TO-114","out of stock","new","This gentle cleanser is anything but ordinary, removing make up and impurities as it retains your skin&rsquo;s moisture &ndash; unlike some harsher cleansers, there&rsquo;s no need to worry about tightness after using this. Star of the show is squalane, a first-class hydrator that&rsquo;s found naturally in the skin, helping to prevent loss of moisture and boost suppleness. This combines with other lipophilic esters to dissolve make up and unwanted grime for clean and clog-free pores. The hard-working formula feels balm-like when first applied, changing to a clear oil-like texture when warmed into your skin &ndash; an important feat that allows emulsifying sucrose esters to capture the dissolved make up and dirt and rinse them away. Free from soap, which can cause irritation or &lsquo;strip&rsquo; the skin, this crowd-pleasing cleanser respects your complexion&rsquo;s natural epidermal lipids, making it suitable for all skin types &ndash; even sensitive ones.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
HOW TO USE

Rub the cleanser in your palms to warm it until it melts into an oil. Massage into dry skin, then rinse with warm water.

A beautiful mix of textures varying from high quality duo chromes, to soft pearl shades, creamy mattes and glitters. Wa- ha- la is a Nigerian Pidgin word. A translation for Drama, trouble and intensity.
We were heavily inspired by the craftmanship of African Masks, which are a full embodiment of culture usually used in ceremonial activities. A mask must come to life by the wearer of the masks to symbolize a mood. We played around with very symbolic colors which represent unity, love, excitement, fruitfulness, boldness, authority, and lastly growth and healing. All of which can be dramatic depending on the wearer of the mask.

"TO-117","in stock","new","An innovative take on sunscreen that does so much more than guard your complexion against the harmful, ageing effects of the sun (though it does that very well indeed) The Ordinary&rsquo;s Mineral UV Filters SPF 15 with Antioxidants offers unrivalled protection. Avoiding the use of nanoparticles (these are small enough to penetrate your skin and get inside your body), The Ordinary has formulated this sunscreen with ultra-refined zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, suspended within non-comedogenic (non-pore-blocking) silicones. This allows the formula to remain extremely lightweight and prevent it from over-burdening your skin. An advanced antioxidant complex scavenges and neutralizes free radicals, minimizes the intensity of UV radiation penetrating the skin, while a bio-sugar complex provides both short and long-term hydration and also naturally increases skin&rsquo;s own capacity to hold water. Finally, Tasmanian pepperberry helps to calm stressed skin for a soothed finish.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
HOW TO USE

Apply to face liberally and evenly 15 to 20 minutes before UV exposure. If continued UV exposure is expected, to maintain protection, reapply at least every 2 hours or after material water exposure, towel-drying, swimming or extensive perspiration. Suitable for all skin tones. For children under 6 months of age, consult a doctor prior to use. Use a water-resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating. For external use only. Do not use on damaged or broken skin. When using this product keep out of eyes. Rinse with water to remove. Stop use and ask a doctor if rash occurs.

Application Tips:
Mineral-based UV filters form a protective barrier to help reflect UV rays away from the skin’s surface. Because the ingredients in a mineral sunscreen stay on the surface of the skin to help protect it, a white cast can sometimes remain after applying the product. Follow these tips to apply your mineral sunscreen:
1. Dispense a small amount to one palm and rub your hands together.
2. Apply to one area of the face at a time and thoroughly massage into the skin.
3. The formula should spread easily without leaving a greasy residue or feel.
All sunscreens should be applied liberally for sun protection. It is essential to use any sunscreen product as directed.
Types of skin:
All skin types, suitable for sensitive skin.
Area of concern:Sun protection
&nbsp;
How to Use -&nbsp;
Directions for Sunscreen Use:

Apply CeraVe Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50 liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure.
Reapply at least every 2 hours and immediately after towel drying.
Use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating.
Children under 6 months of age: ask a doctor.

Sun Protection Measures:&nbsp;Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. To decrease this risk, regularly use a sunscreen with a broad spectrum SPF value of 15 or higher and other sun protection measures including:

Limit time in the sun, especially from 10 a.m-2 p.m.
Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, hats and sunglasses

"3606000537675","out of stock","new","A hydrating cleanser can remove dirt, makeup and other debris. It’s important to choose a formula that won’t disrupt the skin’s natural protective barrier or strip the skin of its natural moisture. CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser is a gentle&nbsp;face wash&nbsp;with ingredients like&nbsp;ceramides&nbsp;which reinforce the barrier and help the skin lock in moisture, along with&nbsp;hyaluronic acid&nbsp;that attracts hydration to the skin’s surface.
CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser was developed with dermatologists to cleanse and refresh the skin without over-stripping it or leaving it feeling tight and dry. Featuring three types of essential ceramides to restore the skin’s barrier and hydrating hyaluronic acid, this non-comedogenic face wash is an effective yet non-irritating way to start off any skincare regimen for normal to dry skin—and it uses&nbsp;MVE Delivery Technology&nbsp;to supply the skin with a steady stream of nourishment throughout the day and night.

Suitable for normal to dry skin
MVE Technology: This patented delivery system continually releases moisturizing ingredients for 24-hour hydration
Ceramides: Essential for healthy skin, ceramides help restore and maintain the skin’s natural barrier
Hyaluronic acid: This ingredient attracts hydration to the skin’s surface and helps the skin retain moisture
Non-comedogenic, non-irritating and fragrance-free

&nbsp;
HOW TO USE

Are you running late? Got an interview? Put on a white shirt? YOU WILL cut yourself shaving. Don’t panic. Mildly curse. Wet the block and rub it gently onto the shaved area you’ve just nicked. Let the alum salts dry on your face. It may hurt, and this is normal – JUST DEAL WITH IT. Once you are ready, clean the alum block with water, dry it off and store in a dry place where air can get to it.

"Natty-16","in stock","new","This Mr Natty comb is handcrafted in Switzerland. Swiss craftsmen use a 12-step process which begins after they’ve extracted the cellulose from poplar wood (or cotton) and made it into a sheet of natural modified polymer. This process then takes the polymer from a slice of cellulose to the beautiful tortoiseshell coloured comb you see here. The 12-steps include shaping, polishing, bevelling the teeth, rounding, brushing and polishing them again so the comb slides neatly through your hair. The comb is shined and polished again (they love a polish) before printing the MR NATTY logo on to remind you who’s taking care of your barnet.
Features:&nbsp;It’s a comb. A really nice one, but still a comb. Run it through your hair to make your parting tight and your locks slick. Resist the temptation to wink at yourself in the mirror – that’s excessive (and if someone catches you, you’ll forever be known as a right winker). If you want some variations on a theme get yourself a sharp pair of scissors for your kit and, by sliding the comb through your beard, lift the straggly hairs away from your face forest and trim the ones that protrude through the teeth. The same technique can be used to trim unruly eyebrows. We believe ‘kestrel’s nests’ is the technical term. But, we might have made that up. By the way, sky rocket means pocket.

Famous Beard Elixir:Skin can get dry under your face forest and some of those hairs have a nasty habit of ingrowing. Just massaging a few drops of our elixir into your beard or heavy stubble will help your face feel invigorated while your skin is gently moisturised (helping to alleviate ingrowing hairs) and your beard is conditioned.
Moustache Twizzle Wax:For best results the Twizzle Wax needs to be warm. Work your finger around the tin to create some heat, then, with your thumb and forefinger, twizzle the wax into your ‘tache in your own Natty style. Keep it in your trousers with your loose change and bus tickets, it should warm it nicely – but hands out of your pockets ‘til you need the stuff, young man.

Vitamin C combines with plant-derived EGF to create a potent dose that helps brighten dull skin. EGF helps skin regeneration and supports natural collagen and elastin within the skin's matrix, while Ascorbyl Glucoside converts to pure Vitamin C on the surface for a brighter, more even-looking complexion.
KEY INGREDIENTS:

15% Ascorbyl Glucoside (Vitamin C): A potent antioxidant that helps brighten the look of skin and protect from environmental stressors.
1% Epitensive™: A plant-derived Epidermal Growth Factor system to support natural elasticity and skin health.

HOW TO USE:

Gentle enough for daily use.
Can be used in AM and PM, however if only using once per day we recommend AM.
On cleansed skin apply a pea-sized amount to face and neck after cleansing and Hyaluronic Acid if you are using.
If you would like to use other skin care products on top, wait around 10 minutes before using them.
This gives the skin cells enough time to respond to the EGF and it won't affect the cell rejuvenation process.
If using in the PM use on a different night to Retinol and AHA exfoliators.&nbsp;

On a mission to promote healthier-looking, smooth lengths, this nourishing blend harnesses an impressive medley of forward-thinking ingredients to reduce frizz and split ends. At the heart of the formula is 10% Granrepair Powerbond – a clinically proven compound that strengthens from within the hair shaft, repairing hydrogen and ionic bonds whilst also protecting existing disulphide bonds from damage. It doesn’t end here, it’s also infused with 0.2% Aquarich to boost glossiness and prevent split ends; 2% crodasone to help protect hair from thermal damage; 0.2% heliogenol to fend against damage from free radicals (pollution isn’t a friend to our hair!); and 2% betaine to condition and soften your strands.
HOW TO USE:

Activate pump by pressing sprayer 2-3 times before your first use.
Shake well before use.
Spray on towel-dried damp hair, covering all of your hair (excluding your scalp), focusing particularly on more damaged areas.
As a guide, we’d suggest spritzing 4-6 sprays through short, fine hair and 6-10 sprays for longer, thicker hair.

After using PCA Bond Repair Hair Treatment (immediately and after a few weeks)&nbsp; people will notice these benefits:

Hair looks healthier, less damaged, less split ends and less prone to breakage

Acne&nbsp;is a common skin concern at any age, spanning from the teen years to adulthood. An effective acne cleanser is the first step in your&nbsp;anti-acne regimen, and it sets the stage for other products that follow, including over-the-counter and prescription-based treatments.&nbsp;





The new CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser is formulated to thoroughly dissolve dirt and excess oil, while clearing acne with 4% benzoyl peroxide. Our formula also features&nbsp;hyaluronic acid&nbsp;to help retain your skin’s natural moisture and&nbsp;niacinamide&nbsp;to provide you with soothing benefits, while allowing your skin to heal.
Developed with dermatologists, our cleanser clears your acne breakouts and helps prevent new blemishes from forming. Gentle on your skin, CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser&nbsp;helps maintain the skin’s barrier with three essential ceramides, leaving your skin feeling soft and comfortable, while reducing acne without dryness or flaking.
HOW TO USE:&nbsp;

Use every morning and evening
Apply a dime-size amount to damp skin and gently massage, avoiding the eye area
Rinse well
Use acne face wash on entire affected area one to two times daily
Because excessive drying of the skin may occur, start with one application daily, then gradually increase to two times daily if needed or as directed by a doctor
If bothersome dryness or peeling occurs, reduce application to once a day or every other day
If going outside, apply sunscreen after using this product. If irritation or sensitivity develops, stop use of both products or ask a doctor

"GL-060","out of stock","new","What it is:&nbsp;A highly concentrated cleanser that exfoliates, clarifies, and re-energizes skin in 60 seconds
WHY IT'S SPECIAL:



An A-team of gentle exfoliators (Grape Ferment, Grape Extract, Lactic Acid, and Malic Acid) wash away dull skin (for a nice, smooth glow!) while Niacinamide visibly refines pores


We opted for soft, frothy Amino Acid Surfactants as a plant-derived alternative to sulfates. They create an undetectable film that holds on to the formula’s key ingredients so they can work on the skin instead of just rinsing down the drain


Soothing Chamomile Flower Water, Calendula Extract, and antioxidant-packed Passionfruit Extract help maintain your skin’s delicate balance of moisture


A small pump feels silky going on the skin, transforms into a smooth foam (like frothed milk on a latte), and leaves you with an incredibly satisfying clean


Cleanser Concentrate is powered by naturally derived plant extracts, fruit juice extract, and fruit ferment. These ingredients can vary in color from bottle to bottle and change over time. This is perfectly normal and does not affect the efficacy of the formula.


How To Use:&nbsp;


Massage one to two pumps into wet skin for 60 seconds—this allows ingredients to fully activate on skin.


Rinse with warm water and pat dry (don’t rub!).


Since this is an exfoliating cleanser, it’s important not to overdo it. Start with one cleanse a day when first introducing it into your routine. Depending on your skin’s needs, you can work up to twice daily. If you have very dry skin, we recommend rotating in Cleanser Concentrate a few times a week, and opting for&nbsp;Milky Jelly Cleanser&nbsp;as your daily conditioning face wash.

"INK062","in stock","new","A gentle exfoliating scrub formulated with both chemical and physical exfoliators to help remove product buildup and dead cells and leave hair looking healthy.
This formula is ideal for every scalp and hair type, calling on 7% glycolic acid to remove dead skin; a ‘Symcontrol Scalp’ complex with Mediterranean microalgae to regulate sebum levels and protect each hair fibre; biodegradable castor beads to elevate the exfoliation experience; and synthesised natural sugars to protect, balance and maintain the scalp’s delicate ecosystem.&nbsp;

The formula, infused with charcoal and clays, aims to enhance the appearance of smoothness and clarity, leaving the skin feeling refreshed. The structure of salicylic acid facilitates its lipophilicity and miscibility with the lipids located on the surface of the skin.
It is a suitable ingredient for targeting the removal of dead skin cells on the surface of oily and blemish-prone skin, with the purpose of revealing more radiant skin beneath. Charcoal and clays are ingredients renowned for their deep cleansing abilities due to their porosity and large surface area available for adsorption. They aid the removal of facial impurities that would otherwise remain on the skin surface and clog pores. In comparison to Salicylic Acid 2% Solution, Salicylic Acid 2% Masque is a rinse-off formula. Leave on for no longer than 10 minutes in order to maximize the exfoliating benefits.
How To Use:&nbsp;

Use once or twice a week on thoroughly clean, dry skin. Do not use on wet skin.
Apply evenly across face using fingertips, avoiding the eye area.
Leave on for no more than 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water.
Do not use on sensitive, peeling or compromised skin.
Avoid the eye contour and contact with eyes both during application and rinse off.
Patch testing prior to use is advised: Apply the product as directed to a small area once a day for three days to test if you are sensitive to this product.

What it is:&nbsp;A nightly retinoid made for just about everyone, that does just about everything: improves the appearance of fine lines, blemishes, pores, dark spots, and uneven tone and texture, all while nourishing skin.
&nbsp;


How to Use






For your evening routine only! Smooth a pea-sized pump over freshly cleansed and patted-dry skin. Wait around 15 seconds for it to fully absorb, and then follow with a moisturizer. Start with one or two nights per week and increase slowly (you can work up to using it every night). Since retinoids may increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun, always use sunscreen the following morning.


Warnings: For external use only. Keep out of eyes. Do not use if pregnant or nursing. This product may increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun, use sunscreen and limit sun exposure while using this product. Stop use if excessive peeling or irritation occurs.


Important reminders: For sensitive skin types, apply a hydrating serum (like&nbsp;Super Bounce) before Universal Pro-Retinol, in addition to following with a moisturizer. If you’re new to retinoids, try patch testing on a small area (like your wrist) before committing to using all over your face. If you’re also using Alpha Hydroxy Acids or other chemical exfoliators (like&nbsp;Solution), acne treatments (like&nbsp;Zit Stick), or other retinoid products consider alternating nights with Universal Pro-Retinol.

"PC-2496503","in stock","new","An advanced anti-aging lip treatment that smooths away fine lines and keeps lips looking youthfully full with a powerful blend of moisture-attracting hyaluronic acid, firming peptides and hydrating squalane.
Why is it different?

Hyaluronic acid and konjac sponge spheres visibly boost lip volume by absorbing water that would normally evaporate, holding it there and expanding it. Firming peptides support lip’s natural shape and encourage repair for a fuller, less-lined appearance. Squalane and soy plus cocoa and shea butters deliver an extra boost of antioxidant-rich hydration.
What does it do?
This innovative, dewy-finish lip treatment goes beyond moisturizing to give lips a fuller, younger look. It instantly smooths, softens and visibly diminishes lines on lips with a hyaluronic-peptide blend that discourages further signs of lip aging.
&nbsp;
How to use

Apply throughout the day as needed and before bedtime. For daytime, always finish with lip sunscreen. Store at 68-77°F (20-25° C). Metal applicator can become hot with prolonged exposure to heat or sunlight.

Use nightly or in alternation with the other Drunk Elephant cleansers.-Tip: We recommend skipping the morning cleanse, as it’s not necessary if you’ve cleansed your skin the night before.B-Hydra™ Intensive Hydration Serum:-Apply B-HydraTM to face, neck, chest, hands, or any place needing increased hydration.-Mix with any Drunk Elephant serum, oil, or cream to lock it in.-Tip: Exfoliate regularly to ensure maximum absorption of the product.C-Firma™ Fresh Day Serum:-Pour all of the liquid serum base into the vial containing the 15% l-ascorbic acid powder.

The mask itself is made from non woven cotton, each heat cell contains iron powder, vermiculite, activated carbon, salt, and water, all naturally occurring ingredients. The mask is naturally chamomile scented and free from artificial ingredients.
How it works?
When the pouch is opened, the iron powder inside heat cells reacts with oxygen in the air causing it to heat up gently.

"72262","in stock","new","Celebrate warm weather with a new twist on the cult-classic: Farmacy Sweet Apple Clean. The bestselling formula that instantly melts away makeup, sunscreen, and pollution residue is now infused with the delicious, juicy flavor of freshly sliced red apples. The fun, two-layered balm-to-oil formula has a vibrant, pink-toned surface with a golden-yellow core. Fun fact: The apple extract in the formula is upcycled from the making of apple juice.
Why It’s Special

Infused with apple extract.&nbsp;Not only does apple give this makeup melting cleansing balm an irresistibly refreshing scent, but it also helps hydrate skin!
Two-layered surprise.&nbsp;This vegan, silicone-free, paraben-free apple cleanser has a vibrant, pink-toned surface with a golden yellow core.
Melts makeup + pollution residue.&nbsp;Just like in our original cleansing balm, sunflower and moringa seed oils gently remove even the boldest eye makeup and long-wear foundation without stripping or drying, leaving skin hydrated and silky smooth. Moringa extract lifts away dirt, grime and impurities from pollution.
Gently exfoliates.&nbsp;Papaya extract turns this formula into an exfoliating cleansing balm, retexturizing skin and revealing a youthful glow. Never harsh, it’s safe for all skin types, including dry and delicate skin.
Ready for travel.&nbsp;A unique face cleansing balm, it stays solid (no spills!) until it melts into a silky oil on contact with skin, which means it’s carry-on friendly and ready for travel.

How To Use:&nbsp;

Gently massage balm to oil cleanser onto dry skin.
For eye makeup removal, apply to closed eyes.
Rinse with warm water or wipe off with a damp washcloth.&nbsp;

"PAU001-1","in stock","new","When the breakout hits, this Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant from PAULA’S CHOICE is an essential in your skin care armoury. Ideal for blemish-prone, oily or combination types, this non-abrasive formula is laced with BHA salicylic acid to remove dead skin cells both on the skin’s surface and within the pore. Combined with its anti-inflammatory properties, this helps to reduce blemishes and blackheads for a more clarified complexion (hurrah!). Aiding salicylic acid in its blemish-clearing mission, methylpropanediol enhances absorption so you can get the most out of each and every ingredient, while simultaneously boosting hydration levels, and green tea extract delivers a hefty dose of antioxidants to soothe and protect. With a fluid toner-like consistency, the formula sinks easily into skin.
How to use : 

Apply once or twice daily after cleansing and/or toning. Lightly soak a cotton pad and apply over the entire face, including the eye area (avoid lash line and eyelids). Do not rinse. For daytime, follow with a broad-spectrum sunscreen rated SPF 30 or greater.
If you have a salicylate allergy, check with your physician before using any products that contain salicylic acid.

Start Slowly:&nbsp;Apply every other day and note skin's response. Then use up to twice daily. For daytime, always finish with SPF 30+. For nighttime, follow with the rest of your routine.
What does it do?
Skin becomes dull, dry and congested when dead skin cells build up on its surface. Beta hydroxy acid (BHA, also known as salicylic acid) mimics the natural exfoliation process of younger skin by helping it shed extra layers while unclogging and clearing pores.

"dr-jart-cryo","in stock","new","The two-step system includes a highly concentrated ampoule gel-like serum packed with actives and a prebiotic complex, as well as a soft, flexible rubber mask made of naturally derived algae and clay to hydrate and soothe the skin for an instant pick-me-up. After 30-40 minutes of masking this cooling technology decreases skin's temperature to help increase blood circulation for absorption of ingredients deeper into the skin. The hydrating rubber face mask wraps the skin to prevent active ingredients from evaporating, allowing for more complete penetration. Cryo Rubber Mask with Brightening Vitamin C contains Vitamin C and Niacinimade to dissolve excess pigmented dead skin cells while Sea Buckthorn Fruit Extract promotes Vitamin C to help brighten the complexion. This mask is for all skin types experiencing dark spots, dullness, and puffiness. CLINICAL RESULTS: In a clinical study of 20 adults women aged 20-60, the cooling effect of rubber mask stimulated blood circulation and reduced redness: *Red spots were reduced by 27.4% *Skin temperature was temporarily reduced by 12.60°F *Blood flow increased by 2.6% WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW: Cryo Rubber Masks were inspired by Cryo Therapy: a process in which the body is “frozen” at -120°C to lower the body temperature. It is used as a recovery method to reset the body back to a healthy state. Where did the name come from? ‘Cryo’ comes from the Greek word kryos meaning ‘cold’ and ‘Rubber’ is in reference to the 85% naturally-derived ingredients that make up the rubber mask material. Cryo Rubber is an innovative two-step mask set that packs the renewing effect of cryo therapy in an at-home treatment.
How to use
Step 1: Apply the stick ampoule (Step 01) onto skin. Step 2: Open rubber mask pouch (Step 02), remove from film, and fit onto entire face. Proceed by applying the ‘lower mask’ by pulling both ends up to the ears. *Leave on for 30-40 minutes for deeper absorption. Step 3: Remove the mask and lightly pat skin to help absorb remaining ampoule. *Pro tip: For an even cooler condition, place both steps 1 and 2 in the refrigerator for 20-30 mins before application. *Pro tip: Follow up with Cicapair™ Tiger Grass Serum to maximize the soothing and repairing effect even further.

"dr-jart-cryo-rubber","in stock","new","A soothing two-step rubber mask inspired by Cryo therapy that lowers skin's temperature to increase blood flow and absorption of powerful active ingredients for a radiant, healthy-looking complexion. The two-step system includes a highly concentrated ampoule gel-like serum packed with actives and a prebiotic complex, as well as a soft, flexible rubber mask made of naturally derived algae and clay to hydrate and soothe the skin for an instant pick-me-up. After 30-40 minutes of masking this cooling technology decreases skin's temperature to help increase blood circulation for absorption of ingredients deeper into the skin. The hydrating rubber face mask wraps the skin to prevent active ingredients from evaporating, allowing for more complete penetration. Cryo Rubber Mask with Soothing Allantoin contains soothing Allantoin to support the skin's natural healing process and protect from environmental irritants while Tiger Grass calms redness and irritation.
CLINICAL RESULTS: In a clinical study of 20 adults women aged 20-60, the cooling effect of rubber mask stimulated blood circulation and reduced redness: *Skin redness was reduced by 30.9% *Skin temperature was temporarily reduced by 12.06°F *Blood flow increased by 2.7% WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW: Our Cryo Rubber Masks were inspired by Cryo Therapy: a process in which the body is “frozen” at -120°C to lower the body temperature. It is used as a recovery method to reset the body back to a healthy state. Where did the name come from? ‘Cryo’ comes from the Greek word kryos meaning ‘cold’ and ‘Rubber’ is in reference to the 85% naturally-derived ingredients that make up the rubber mask material. Cryo Rubber is an innovative two-step mask set that packs the renewing effect of cryo therapy in an at-home treatment.
How to use
Step 1: Apply the stick ampoule (Step 01) onto skin. Step 2: Open rubber mask pouch (Step 02), remove from film, and fit onto entire face. Proceed by applying the ‘lower mask’ by pulling both ends up to the ears. *Leave on for 30-40 minutes for deeper absorption. Step 3: Remove the mask and lightly pat skin to help absorb remaining ampoule. *Pro tip: For an even cooler condition, place both steps 1 and 2 in the refrigerator for 20-30 mins before application. *Pro tip: Follow up with Cicapair™ Tiger Grass Serum to maximize the soothing and repairing effect even further. You can use the remaining Ampoule Pack on your neck and arms as well. Precaution: Handle mask with care.

Direct acids, specifically alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), are renowned for their ability to support the natural shedding of dead skin. While AHAs aim to promote superficial exfoliation, Salicylic Acid (SA), a lipophilic BHA, is particularly effective at targeting oil within the pores that can lead to congestion. The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution offers salicylic acid in a squalane base formulated with the intent of reducing concerns of skin irritation that can be associated with the use of SA.

Skin Type:&nbsp;Normal, Dry, Combination, and OilySkincare Concerns:&nbsp;Fine Lines and Wrinkles, Uneven Texture, and Loss of Firmness and Elasticity
Key Ingredients:

Retinal (Retinaldehyde) 0.15%: Advanced vitamin A derivative reduces the visible signs of aging and improves the look and feel of skin texture.
Niacinamide 5%: Visibly rebalances tone, refines pores, and reinforces skin's barrier to maximize receptivity to retinal.
Adapotgenic Mushroom + Ceramide Complex: Fatty acids and antioxidant-rich mushrooms visibly smooth, replenish moisture, and neutralize signs of sensitivity.&nbsp;

Meet the retinal with an 'a': retinaldehyde. It's the most potent retinoid next to an Rx and works smarter, not harder with niacinamide and ceramides in this balanced formula to hydrate, visibly smooth, and deliver maximal results for all skin types without the typical irritation.&nbsp;
How To Use:&nbsp;

At night, apply a pea-sized amount to clean, dry face and neck, avoiding the eye area.
Use once a week to start, gradually increasing frequency to every night, as tolerated.
Follow with Adaptogen Deep Moisture Cream or Superberry Hydrate + Glow Dream Oil.
Always wear a broad-spectrum SPF during the day while using retinal.
